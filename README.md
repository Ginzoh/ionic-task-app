"# ionic-task-app"
You get sent to the Home page that redirects you to the login page. Like any login page you can only enter the taskmaker page by entering
a login and password that's in the firestore database, for now you need to login twice, once to see that you're really logged in then again
to enter the taskmaker page.

On the taskmaker page, there's one button that downloads a pdf called "PDF", in the body of the page you can find every task by name that is
currently in the database, by clicking on it you can see the name and description and change one or the other or even leave description empty
but you got to have a title for the task or it won't let you update. When you update it won't show right away on the update page but if you go
back to the taskmaker page you'll see the update has been made. On the update page there's also a button "Delete"if you wish to delete that task.

Again on the taskmaker page you can click the button "+ADD" to add a new task, just like update, you need a title and maybe a description.
